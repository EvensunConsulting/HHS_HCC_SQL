/* This is the logic that updates the severity flag and severe / interaction HCC beginnig with the 2023 benefit year; skipped if benefit year is 2022 or earlier. 

Assumes payment HCC count logic is applied after hierarchies and groupers are applied. For example, if a member has HCC019 and HCC020, HCC is only counted once (under G01). 

Assumes that RXCs and RXC interaction factors are not counted in payment HCC count for both the severity / transplant flag and the EDF indicator
